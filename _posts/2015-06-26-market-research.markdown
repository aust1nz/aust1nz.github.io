This is my second post in a [series]({% post_url 2015-06-26-market-research %}) where I attempt to build a job board and applicant tracking system in Rails from scratch. So far, I haven't written a line of code. Today, I'll take a look at the vast landscape of competitors for this purpose and take a smaller look at the actual use of open-source apps. Next post, I'll start thinking about how to plan for and design the first steps of this project.

#### A Glut of Options
If your company or organization is hiring someone, you will face a wide array of next steps to advertise your position and bring candidates into your view. (If you've ever hired, you might know that this process can be somewhat terrifying, like sorting through a haystack, but that's a separate concern.) As I see it, you'll be looking at two popular options with a third that is relevant for my app.

* __Public job boards__: [Monster](http://www.monster.com/) or [Indeed](http://www.indeed.com/) or [Glassdoor](http://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/job/home) or [Ziprecruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/). You get the point.
    
    The basic premise is that you post your job opening here and then gain access to a bunch of candidates, who also see your job. These sites create a sort of marketplace for jobseekers and employers. They're ideal for employers who don't have a whole job posting system or who are seeking more publicity than their own job board can provide.

    They're also used by bigger employers as a secondary place to post their current jobs, and (especially Indeed) will even crawl the web posting jobs unsolicited.

* __Open source Applicant Tracking Software__:
