Destiny is kind of fun but I feel like it is a bit of a rip off too. For example, I have a friend who got a full set of purple armor just from strikes. But I didn't get any purple armor unless I bought it myself. Waaaaah!

It's fun most of the time and I find myself wanting to play it while I'm at work. But, on the other hand, once I've been playing it for a while I'm like, "Why am I still playing this game?" Since you basically do the same four or five strikes over and over and over, even after they cease to be challenging.

I'd probably be reinvigorated if I could somehow do the more challenging content without having more friends. I only have one friend nerdy enough to also play these games.

OK, that's enough for now.
