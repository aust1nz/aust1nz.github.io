title: "'Contact Me' Forms in Static Sites"
draft: true
---
In my [first post]({% post_url 2015-06-22-building-with-jekyll %}) on this blog, I talked about all the reasons that a static site can be useful for a portfolio site. That said, there's one glaring deficiency out of the box: without a database, it's difficult for visitors to leave a note or get in touch with you.

This post outlines a single-page solution using [Formspree](http://formspree.io/), an awesome service that can email you the contents of forms filled out on your site, with a free tier that should be fine for most low-traffic portfolio sites like mine.
