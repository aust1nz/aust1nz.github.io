description: A totally custom Salesforce dashboard that lets DCPS hiring managers screen potential candidates using their own selection plans.
---

__The Problem:__ DCPS uses the Salesforce platform for our [job board](http://dcps.force.com/central){:target="_blank"} and applicant tracking system. While the system met the needs of power users, hiring managers who used it infrequently were often confused by the many menus and the frustrated by the rigid, specific instructions they needed to follow to begin screening candidates.

As a result, hiring processes often occurred entirely outside of the system, and occasionally applications were never reviewed because of the complexity.

__The Solution:__ We built a completely custom screening dashboard for our hiring managers, complete with a flexible screening setup for each individual job. Best of all, we were able to continue using the Salesforce framework, by taking advantage of Salesforce's Apex and Visualforce developer tools.

__The Results:__ Our hiring managers engage with the system earlier and more frequently. We can accommodate a variety of screening practices, from a straightforward resume review to interview, up to a complex six-stage screening process. With hiring managers in the system, we're better able to engage which applications are moving forward, and which candidates are successful.
