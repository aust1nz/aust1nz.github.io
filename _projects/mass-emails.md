### Project Summary
</div>

__Problem:__ The Office of Talent and Culture spent a lot of time creating and approving email templates that were mostly reused year over year. Because templates were shared on individual computers and sent via mail merge or mass-BCC processes, it was difficult to find exactly what was sent.

__Solution:__ A low-cost alternative to a service like Mailchimp that perfectly fit our business needs.

__Results:__ TBD. This project is just getting off of the ground.
