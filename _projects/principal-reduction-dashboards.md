description: A straightforward but comprehensive web application for principals to use during the annual budgeting and reduction process, in order to make the most informed staffing decisions for their schools.
---

__The Problem:__ The annual DCPS school-based budget and staff reduction process has a lot of moving parts, and historically principals have had trouble easily seeing the implications of budget changes, or determining what effects their rubrics would have.

__The Solution:__ In spring of 2016, we redesigned principals' staff validation and reduction tool using Angular.js and Bootstrap to build a snappy and responsive set of principal pages, using QuickBase as a back-end.

Let's jump in!
