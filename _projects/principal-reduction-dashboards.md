description: A straightforward but comprehensive web application for principals to use during the annual budgeting and reduction process, in order to make the most informed staffing decisions for their schools.

__The Problem:__ The annual DCPS school-based budget and staff reduction process has a lot of moving parts, and historically principals have had trouble easily seeing the implications of budget changes, or determining what effects their rubrics would have.

__The Solution:__ In spring 2016, we redesigned principals' staff validation and reduction tool using Angular.js and Bootstrap to build a snappy and responsive set of principal pages, with QuickBase as a back-end.

__The Result:__ The redesign helped principals more easily see what staffing implications their budgets held, and adjust accordingly. In the event that principals needed to reduce positions, the implications of their reductions were clear.

### Validation Pages

The first step in the process is validating our HR list of staff. Though our HR system is relatively accurate, our position titles don't always match to the competitive levels used in the budgeting and reduction processes. (For example, a teacher's position might be 'Teacher, General Secondary,' but it's relevant here to determine whether those teachers are assigned to particular subjects.)
