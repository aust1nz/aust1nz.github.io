description: An easy way for principals to match candidates to vacancies.

Principals fill open positions at DCPS in a somewhat unusual fashion: our central office completes an initial screen for candidates, and then principals make a final selection from the pool of approved candidates (or choose someone they've found through other means.)

In the summer of 2014, we created a dashboard that showed principals appropriate details from the screening process, and helped them to save or select candidates for hire, which alerts our schools staffing team that the candidate can receive an official offer.
